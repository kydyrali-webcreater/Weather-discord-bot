# Weather-discord-bot
This bot can show the weather
Since discord resets the bot token when publishing it anywhere, you will have to change the token and watherAPIKey in the main.go file: 

const token = "Your Token"
const weatherAPIKey = "OpenWeatherAPIKey" 

And link to add that bot to your channel: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1203647466201677855&permissions=8&scope=bot
